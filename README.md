# Veritas - AI Verification & Forensics Platform

**Veritas** is an advanced, automated media forensics system designed to empower news agencies, journalists, and researchers in the fight against digital disinformation. In an era where deepfakes and AI-generated content are becoming indistinguishable from reality, Veritas provides a rapid, first-line defense by leveraging multimodal AI to analyze the integrity of digital assets.

Powered by Google's **Gemini 2.0 Flash** model, Veritas offers real-time verification across text, image, audio, and video formats. It combines pattern recognition, semantic analysis, and (optional) live web grounding to deliver a comprehensive authenticity verdict.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multimodal Forensic Analysis
Veritas handles distinct media types with specialized forensic protocols simulated by the AI:

*   **📄 Text Verification**:
    *   **LLM Fingerprinting**: Detects syntax patterns, repetitive phrasing, and lack of perplexity typical of AI language models.
    *   **Fact-Checking**: Cross-references claims against internal knowledge bases.
    *   **Logical Consistency**: Identifies internal contradictions within narrative structures.

*   **🖼️ Image Forensics**:
    *   **Error Level Analysis (ELA) Simulation**: Scans for compression inconsistencies that suggest manipulation.
    *   **Generative Artifact Detection**: Looks for tell-tale signs of diffusion models (e.g., warped hands, text rendering errors, unnatural lighting).
    *   **Metadata Inspection**: Analyzes EXIF/IPTC headers for editing software signatures.

*   **🎙️ Audio Analysis**:
    *   **Spectral Anomaly Detection**: Identifies "perfect" silence or frequency cutoffs common in synthetic voice cloning.
    *   **Breathing & Pauses**: Verifies the natural occurrence of breath sounds and hesitation markers.
    *   **Splicing Detection**: Checks for background noise discontinuities.

*   **🎥 Video Deepfake Detection**:
    *   **Temporal Consistency**: Checks if face landmarks jitter or morph inconsistently between frames.
    *   **Lip-Sync Analysis**: Verifies that audio phonemes match visual mouth movements (visemes).
    *   **Lighting Physics**: Ensures shadows and reflections behave realistically across the scene.

### 2. 🌍 Live Web Provenance (Search Grounding)
Veritas can optionally connect to **Google Search** to perform "grounding".
*   **Reverse Search**: Checks if an image or video frame appears in existing stock libraries or news articles.
*   **Context Verification**: Determines if a specific event description correlates with real-world news reporting.
*   **Source Attribution**: Helps identify if content was previously flagged as satire, fake, or AI-generated by fact-checking organizations.

### 3. 📊 Comprehensive Reporting
The system generates a detailed JSON-structured report visualized for easy consumption:
*   **Authenticity Verdict**: `Authentic`, `Fake/Generated`, `Suspicious`, or `Inconclusive`.
*   **Trust Score**: A 0-100% confidence gauge.
*   **Executive Summary**: A human-readable overview of the analysis.
*   **Technical Drill-down**: Expandable sections explaining specific passed/failed checks (e.g., "Shadow coherence: Fail - Light source direction mismatch").

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Core Engine**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) using `gemini-2.0-flash`.
*   **Frontend Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a responsive, "cyber-security" aesthetic.
*   **Visualization**: Recharts for data metrics.
*   **Build Tool**: Vite/ESM.
*   **Architecture**: Serverless/Client-side. The app communicates directly with the Gemini API from the browser, ensuring low latency.

## 💻 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
*   A modern web browser.
*   A Google AI Studio API Key.

### Running the Application
1.  **Launch**: Open the application in your browser.
2.  **API Key**: On first load, you will be prompted to connect your Google API Key.
    *   Veritas supports the `window.aistudio` credential manager for secure, one-click authentication.
    *   Alternatively, the key can be injected via `process.env.API_KEY` for development builds.
3.  **Analyze**:
    *   Select the tab corresponding to your media (`Text`, `Image`, `Voice/Audio`, `Video`).
    *   Upload the file or paste the text.
    *   *(Optional)* Toggle "Web Search Provenance" for deeper verification.
    *   Click **Run Analysis**.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

Veritas utilizes advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to *simulate* forensic analysis and reason about media content. While highly effective at detecting patterns associated with AI generation, it is **probabilistic**, not deterministic.
*   It may produce false positives or negatives.
*   It should not be the sole basis for legal or critical journalistic decisions.
*   Always corroborate findings with traditional forensic tools and human judgment.
