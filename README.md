# Veritas - Detect Fake Media with AI

**Veritas** helps you figure out if a photo, video, audio, or text is real or fake. It uses artificial intelligence to spot deepfakes, AI-generated images, and misleading content.

## What Does Veritas Do?

### 🖼️ Check Images
Upload any image and Veritas will tell you:
- Is this a real photo or AI-generated?
- Has someone edited or manipulated this image?
- Are there signs of Photoshop or other editing tools?
- Does the lighting and shadows look natural?

**How it works**: The AI looks for tiny mistakes that fake images often have - like weird hands, blurry text, or lighting that doesn't match.

---

### 🎥 Check Videos
Upload a video to detect deepfakes:
- Is the face in the video real or pasted on?
- Do the lips match what the person is saying?
- Does the face move naturally or does it glitch?

**How it works**: The AI watches the video frame by frame, looking for unnatural face movements or audio that doesn't sync with the mouth.

---

### � Check Audio
Upload an audio file to detect voice cloning:
- Is this a real human voice or AI-generated?
- Are there signs of audio editing or splicing?
- Does the voice have natural breathing and pauses?

**How it works**: Real voices have tiny imperfections - breaths, pauses, background noise. Fake voices are often "too perfect" or have robotic patterns.

---

### � Check Text
Paste any text to detect AI writing:
- Was this written by a human or ChatGPT/AI?
- Are there patterns typical of AI-generated text?
- Is the content logically consistent?

**How it works**: AI-written text often has repetitive patterns, overuses certain phrases, and lacks the natural variation of human writing.

## How the Trust Score Works

After analysis, you get a **Trust Score** from 0-100%:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100% | **Authentic** - Very likely real |
| 50-79% | **Suspicious** - Some warning signs found |
| 0-49% | **Fake/Generated** - Likely AI-made or manipulated |

The system also shows you exactly WHY it made its decision - like "Face pixels don't match" or "Unnatural word patterns detected".

## Web Search Feature

When you enable **Web Search Provenance**, Veritas also:
- Searches the internet to see if this image appeared before
- Checks if this content was already flagged as fake
- Finds the original source if it was copied from somewhere

---

## The AI Learning System

Veritas gets smarter over time. When it makes a mistake, you can tell it:
- "This was actually real" or "This was actually fake"
- The AI remembers these corrections
- Next time it sees similar content, it does better

## Important: Veritas is a Tool, Not a Judge

⚠️ **Please Remember:**
- Veritas uses AI predictions - it can be wrong sometimes
- Always double-check important findings with other sources
- Don't use this as the only evidence for serious decisions
- It's a helpful first step, not the final answer

---

## Who Should Use Veritas?

- **Journalists** - Verify images and videos before publishing
- **Researchers** - Study patterns in fake content
- **Regular People** - Check suspicious posts on social media
- **Organizations** - Screen content for authenticity
